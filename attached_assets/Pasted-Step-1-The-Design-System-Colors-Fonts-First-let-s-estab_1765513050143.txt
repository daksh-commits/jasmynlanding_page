Step 1: The Design System (Colors & Fonts)
First, let's establish the "Look and Feel" based on your screenshot. The screenshot uses a style called "Glassmorphism" with soft pastel gradients.

Hex Codes derived from the image:

Primary Action (Buttons/Accents): #6366F1 (Soft Indigo/Violet)

Secondary Accent: #A5B4FC (Periwinkle)

Background: White #FFFFFF fading into very soft Lavender #F3E8FF and pale Blue #E0F2FE.

Text: Dark Navy #0F172A (Headings) and Slate Grey #64748B (Body).

Font: Plus Jakarta Sans or Inter (Round, modern, clean).

Step 2: The Master Prompt (Copy & Paste this first)
Copy this into the Lovable chat:

I want to build a high-converting SaaS landing page for an AI software called "Jasmyn."

Design Style Reference: Please mimic the aesthetic of a modern, ethereal SaaS platform.

Vibe: Calm, futuristic, warm, hyper-efficient, and airy.

Backgrounds: Use a white background with very soft, dreamy mesh gradients in the corners (pale lavender #F3E8FF and soft cyan #E0F2FE).

Components: Use "Glassmorphism" effects (white cards with high transparency, blur, and soft white borders) for content blocks.

Typography: Use "Plus Jakarta Sans" or "Inter". Round, clean, and professional.

Shapes: Use highly rounded corners (border-radius: 24px) for buttons and cards.

Primary Color: Soft Indigo/Violet (#6366F1) for main CTA buttons.

Page Structure & Content:

Navbar: Logo "JASMYN" (clean, minimal), Links: Features, Persona, Pricing, Login. CTA Button: "Hire Jasmyn".

Hero Section:

Headline: "The AI employee your business always wished it had."

Subheadline: "Jasmyn is not a tool. She is not an assistant. She is an AI teammate who handles calls, bookings, and leads instantly."

Visual: In the center, place a floating, glass-effect dashboard UI mock-up that looks high-tech but clean.

CTA: "Meet Jasmyn" (Primary button) and "Watch Demo" (Secondary, outline style).

Value Proposition (Grid Layout):

Title: "More than software. A presence."

Create a 3-column grid with these cards:

Card 1 (Reliability): Icon: Shield/Check. Text: "She shows up instantly. No breaks. No moods. Always polite."

Card 2 (Competence): Icon: Brain/Sparkle. Text: "She never says 'loading.' She speaks clearly, helps instantly, and explains simply."

Card 3 (Scale): Icon: Chart/Growth. Text: "Businesses feel bigger when she’s around. She handles 70+ calls a day effortlessly."

The "Emotional Positioning" Section (Bento Grid Style):

Headline: "This is what customers feel:"

Use a masonry/bento grid layout for these quotes in large, elegant typography:

"She handled it."

"I can trust her."

"She makes my business feel bigger."

"My customers are talking to someone who understands them."

Feature Showcase (Alternating Layout):

Left Image / Right Text: Title: "Learning & Evolving." Text: "You don't create features; you teach Jasmyn skills. She is learning to book appointments, qualify leads, and handle sales questions."

Right Image / Left Text: Title: "Always Professional." Text: "Zero ego. No drama. Jasmyn never uses slang, never gets emotional, and never misses a detail."

Footer: Simple, clean, with links and a subtle "Powered by [Your Company]" tag.

Step 3: Refinement Prompts (Use these to tweak the result)
Once Lovable generates the first version, it likely won't be perfect. Use these prompts to refine specific areas based on your persona document.

To fix the Colors/Vibe (if it looks too dark or generic):

"Make the design more 'airy.' Increase the whitespace between sections. Make the background gradients softer and more pastel (lavender and light blue). Ensure the cards have a white background with 0.5 opacity and a backdrop-blur effect (glassmorphism)."

To add the "Jasmyn" Persona details (The Visuals):

"For the images/placeholders on the site, I want to convey the character of Jasmyn. She is a 'Futuristic Receptionist.' Please add an 'About Jasmyn' section with a clean layout. Content for this section:

Visual Style: White futuristic uniform, soft purple LED lines, short pink hair.

Vibe: Calm, intelligent, soft-spoken.

Copy: 'If Siri and Tesla AutoPilot had a daughter who worked in customer support… That’s Jasmyn.'"

To fix the Typography (Make it look like the screenshot):

"Change the font to 'Plus Jakarta Sans'. Make the main Headings bold and dark navy (#0F172A). Make the body text a readable slate grey (#64748B). Ensure the buttons are pill-shaped (fully rounded)." ""Use the color palette, button styling, and shadow depth from this uploaded image, but apply it to the content structure I gave you in the prompt."""
