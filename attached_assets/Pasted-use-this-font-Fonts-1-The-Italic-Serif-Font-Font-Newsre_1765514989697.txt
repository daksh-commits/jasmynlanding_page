use this font: Fonts

1. The Italic Serif Font
* Font: Newsreader (Italic)
    * Why: It features the high contrast and sharp serifs of a modern "transitional" typeface. The lowercase "y" has a simple curved tail (unlike Playfair Display, which loops), and the "f" has the characteristic teardrop/ball terminal. It is a very popular Google Font for modern web design, often used to pair with clean sans-serifs.
    * Alternative: It is very similar to Apple's New York font, but given this looks like a web template, Newsreader is the most likely match.
2. The Bold Headline Font
* Font: Inter (Bold or Extra Bold)
    * Why: This is the quintessential "modern tech" font. Key indicators are the "k" (where the bottom leg meets the slanted arm, not the vertical stem), the double-story "a", and the curved tail on the "t".
    * Note: The text in the image has tight tracking (letter spacing is squeezed closer together), which is a specific stylistic choice often used with Inter to make headlines look punchy (sometimes called "Inter Tight").
3. The Body Text
* Font: Inter (Regular)
    * Why: It matches the headline font family perfectly. The double-story "g" in "progress" and the clean, tall x-height are standard features of Inter.
Summary for Recreation: If you are trying to recreate this look, use Newsreader Italic for the accent text and Inter (with -4% or -5% letter spacing on the bold headers) for the rest. Both are available for free via Google Fonts.
