# Big Feature Cards Implementation

I have upgraded the **Features Section** to use a premium "Big Card" design.

## Changes
-   **Mobile Optimization**: Added tailored responsiveness.
    -   **Mobile**: `min-h-[550px]` cards, `scale-110` animations, `gap-6` spacing.
    -   **Desktop**: `h-[85vh]` cards, `scale-[1.8]` animations, `gap-12` spacing.
-   **Visuals**: `#FCFCFC`, `shadow-2xl`, 3D depth maintained across all devices.
-   **Consistent Animations**: Abstract icon loops for all features.

## Verification Results
I navigated to the local development server and verified the new section.
